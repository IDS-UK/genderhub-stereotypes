  Unfortunately WordPress will require a style.css file

  located in the theme's root folder for stuff to work.



  However, we will not be using vanilla CSS. We're using Sass.



  Sass is a superset of CSS that adds in amazing features

  such as variables, nested selectors and loops. It's also

  the easiest way to customize Foundation.



  All Sass files are located in the /scss folder.



  Please read the README.md file before getting started. More info on how

  to use Sass with Foundation can be found here:

  http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html
